 List of Practicals
 
 1. Write a program to implement an address book with options given below: a) Create address book. b) View address book. c) Insert a record. d) Delete a record. e) Modify a record. f) Exit
 
 2. Write a Program to implement multithreading for Matrix Operations using Pthreads.
 
 3. Process control system calls: The demonstration of FORK and WAIT system calls along with zombie and orphan states. Implement the program in which the main program accepts the integers to be sorted. Main program uses the FORK system call to create a new process called a child process. Parent process sorts the integers using a sorting algorithm and waits for the child process using WAIT system call to sort the integers using any sorting algorithm. Also demonstrate zombie and orphan states.
 
 4. Implementation of Classical Process Synchronization problems using Threads and Semaphore, Mutex. Application to demonstrate: producer- consumer problem
 
 5. Implementation of Classical Process Synchronization problems using mutex. Application to demonstrate: Reader- Writer problem.
 
 6. Write a program to compute the finish time, turnaround time and waiting time for the  following algorithms: First come First serve b) Shortest Job First (Preemptive and Non Preemptive) c) Priority (Preemptive and Non Preemptive) d) Round robin
 
 7. Write a program to check whether a given system is in safe state or not using Bankerâ€™s Deadlock Avoidance algorithm.
 
 8. Write a program to calculate the number of page faults for a reference string for the following page replacement algorithms: a) FIFO b)LRU c)Optimal
 
 9. Write a program for Disk Scheduling Algorithms: SSTF, SCAN, C-Look considering the initial head position moving away from the spindle
